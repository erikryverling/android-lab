## Running
You need to create a `local.properties` file with the following keys:
* `openWeatherMapApiKey` that contains an API key for [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org)

You also need to add a `google-services.json` file with support for [Firebase AI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started).
